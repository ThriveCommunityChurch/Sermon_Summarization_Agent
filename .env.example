# OpenAI API Key (required for Whisper transcription and GPT-4o-mini summarization)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Whisper model to use (default: small.en)
# Options: tiny, tiny.en, base, base.en, small, small.en, medium, medium.en, large
# Larger models are more accurate but slower. GPU highly recommended for medium/large.
WHISPER_MODEL=small.en

# Optional: Force CPU mode for Whisper (default: false)
# Set to "true" to disable GPU acceleration even if CUDA is available
# GPU (CUDA) is automatically detected and used if available for much faster transcription
WHISPER_FORCE_CPU=false

# Optional: Directory to search for sermon files if no file path is provided
SERMON_AUDIO_DIR=C:\Users\Videos

# Optional: Specific sermon file path (can also be provided via CLI argument)
# SERMON_FILE_PATH=C:\path\to\sermon.mp4

# Video Clip Generation (optional)
# Set to "true" to enable automatic summary video generation
# Requires FFMPEG to be installed and available in system PATH
ENABLE_CLIP_GENERATION=false

# Maximum duration for summary clips in seconds (default: 600 = 10 minutes)
MAX_CLIP_DURATION=600

# Minimum segment length in seconds (default: 30)
# Segments shorter than this will be filtered out to maintain coherence
# Note: With Phase 2 improvements, AI selects 30-60s ranges, so this is less critical
MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH=30

# Context padding in seconds (default: 5)
# Adds this many seconds before/after each selected segment for smoother transitions
CONTEXT_PADDING=5

# Merge gap threshold in seconds (default: 15)
# Segments within this gap will be merged together for better coherence
MERGE_GAP_THRESHOLD=15

# Enable fade transitions between clips (default: true)
# Adds smooth fade-in/fade-out effects between segments
ENABLE_FADE_TRANSITIONS=true

# Fade duration in seconds (default: 0.5)
# Duration of fade-in and fade-out effects at segment boundaries
FADE_DURATION=0.5

# Optional: Custom output directory for clips (default: same directory as original video)
# Leave empty to save clips next to the original video file
# CLIP_OUTPUT_DIR=./clips
